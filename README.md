# Todo App
Here's a demonstration of a todo app, with each of its components (React client, Express REST API and PostgreSQL database) incorporated into and executed from a dedicated container. 

This app allows you to create a todo, then mark it as complete. Not much more to it really!.

It mainly serves as a showcase of how it's possible to create containers for each component and run those containers in one command, then have those containers communicate with each other via a network implicitly created by Docker Compose.



All you need to do is run ```docker compose up -d``` within this directory and you should be good to go! :grin:
